# CSE 1320 - Intermediate Programming
This repository contains all of the assignments done in the Intermediate Programming course at the University of Texas at Arlington, taught by Professor Alex Dillhoff. The assignments were coded in C and C++.

## Assignment 1
This assignment will review CSE1310 concepts.
Specifically, it reviews
- variables
- loops
- functions
- arrays
- file I/O

## Assignment 2
Covers pointers and `struct`

## Assignment 3
This assignment covers stacks and queues.

## Assignment 4
To see how array operations perform versus linked list operations, this assignment will provide a chance to benchmark them.
By simulating the size of each data sample along with the number of samples, you will gain some intuition on the efficiency of inserting elements into each data structure.

## Assignment 5
This assignment covers hash maps, macros, and makefiles.

## Assignment 6
This assignment will demonstrate how much easier it is to work with hash maps using the standard template library (STL) as opposed to the manual implementation we did in C. For this program, you will use a `std::unordered_map<std::string, Monster>` collection where the monster name is the key.
